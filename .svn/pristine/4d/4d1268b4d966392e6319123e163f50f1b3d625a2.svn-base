review: A few things to fix

When the pad hits the border it shrinks.
Show the border of the box.
The ball should escape and disappear if not blocked.

review: good start

No need for keyboard events, instead use mouse and touch events.

See email to the mailing list where I recommended creating good abstractions
and instead of scattered variables. Accidental complexity will go through the roof if we keep many variables and functions, all in the file scope.
