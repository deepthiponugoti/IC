review: improve 2

What would possibly be the benefit of using such a context object or
why bother with this context stuff?

review: nice work on 1. Enhance 2 and fix 3.

"In JavaScript" noise words, we are talking about JavaScript, remove.

1.
"the assignments" you mean "the initializations"?

Good discussion. Nice work.

2.
Scope/context: Are Scope and context the same?
What's the purpose of this context object?

3.
The example is more complex than it should be. Also, there is no use of
apply in the example.
