HW 4. Due 11:59PM August 14th
There will be no reviews for this homework.

1. What are some of the things you learned new in this course? and 2. What's was the most exciting thing you learned?

Everything in the course was new to us and exciting so we thought we better merge question 1 and question 2.

1. Javascript as a language, before the course we were in a illusion that Javascript runs only on browser on even to be specific may be we didn’t even know where it runs. Javascript was like a language from hell, which we never understood while we tried to learn it by copy pasting the code from internet.

2. Test driven development in JavaScript using node unit. This was the first fun part in the course. It’s so easy to mock and test in JavaScript.

3. 

3. If you were to pick JavaScript, would you use it for client-side, server-side, neither, or both. Discuss.

We will definitely pick JavaScript for the client side, and we will evaluate before using it on server side. If we feel that it is beneficial in using it in our project then definitely we shall pick it without backing out. Earlier we had some fear of writing JavaScript code or even reading JavaScript code written by others, but now I guess we are quite comfortable with it.

Server-side code in most of the project requires seamless integration with database and other stuff. We are not sure if there are such libraries which can make the life for a programmer easier if we pick JavaScript.
