HW 4. Due 11:59PM August 14th
There will be no reviews for this homework.

1. What are some of the things you learned new in this course? and 2. What's was the most exciting thing you learned?

Everything in the course was new and exciting to us. So, we thought we better merge question 1 and question 2.

1. Javascript as a language, before the course, we were in an illusion that it runs only on browser or even to be specific may be we didn’t even know where it runs. Javascript was like a language from hell, which we never understood while we tried to learn it by copy pasting the code from internet.

2. We never heard about CoffeeScript before, which we learnt here in this course and worked on the assignment using CoffeeScript.

3. We learnt how to create offline applications using HTML5.

4. We never heard of express before. However, we learnt many new things about it in this course.

5. We also learnt many new concepts about AJAX and JQuery.

6. Test driven development in JavaScript using node unit. We never thought testing in JavaScript was so easy. This was the first fun part in the course. It’s so easy to mock and test in JavaScript.

7. We never knew or heard before about the concept of asynchronous callback functions. It was really new and exciting to us to learn such new concepts.

8. We always followed the concept of "Make it work" when developing applications. But, after the course, we now understood that it needs to be modified as "Make it work. Make it better soon".



3. If you were to pick JavaScript, would you use it for client-side, server-side, neither, or both. Discuss.

We will definitely pick JavaScript for the client side, and we will evaluate before using it on server side. If we feel that it is beneficial in using it in our project, then definitely we shall pick it without backing out. Earlier we had some fear of writing JavaScript code or even reading JavaScript code written by others, but now I guess we are quite comfortable with it.

However, server-side code in most of the project requires seamless integration with database and other stuff. We are not sure if there are such libraries which can make the life of the programmer easier if we pick JavaScript.
