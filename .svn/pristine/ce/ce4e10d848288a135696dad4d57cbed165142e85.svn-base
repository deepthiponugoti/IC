review: Fix collision issues

All the ball seem to start in the same direction instead of random
directions.

Hit test has bugs, the ball ran out even when pad was on its way (at a
greater speed that is).

When balls collide they have to bound off of each other.

review: A few things to fix

When the pad hits the border it shrinks.
Show the border of the box.
The ball should escape and disappear if not blocked.

review: good start

No need for keyboard events, instead use mouse and touch events.

See email to the mailing list where I recommended creating good abstractions
and instead of scattered variables. Accidental complexity will go through the roof if we keep many variables and functions, all in the file scope.
