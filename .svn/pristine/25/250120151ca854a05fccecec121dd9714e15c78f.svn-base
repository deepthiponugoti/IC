review: simplify

Check coverage.

playGame.jade - too much html in there.

Why not use html table instead of canvas, will that not be simpler?

review: nice progress

include html? Pick up Jade, it's not that hard, break out of your comfort zone.

Move on to implement accept/invite.

Check coverage.

review: good start

1. Visited page, entered Joe, seeing welcome page.

2. Visited using another browser, entered Bob, seeing Joe in the welcome page.

3. Joe should see Bob now. Also, when Bob clicks invite, nothing is happening.

In jade file, don't write raw HTML!

Check coverage.
