review: good start

Fill the date of creation with the current date as default.

When button is submitted, give a clue to the user what happened,
saved locally or sent to the server.

Embrace test driven development, at least make an effort.

Give a better name than functions.js for this file.

Change app.js to server.js to easily identify this is the server to use.
