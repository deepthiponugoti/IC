review: excellent progress

Nice job with connected session. Nice feedback on submit order. Good job.

Once submit is clicked, the data field is lost, set it back to 
current date as default.

After a second or two, remove the feedback message. If it remain there,
and the user performs next action, now we are not sure if it worked or not.

contentType: May be this can be turned into a map lookup instead of 
if/else.

review: good start

Fill the date of creation with the current date as default.

When button is submitted, give a clue to the user what happened,
saved locally or sent to the server.

Embrace test driven development, at least make an effort.

Give a better name than functions.js for this file.

Change app.js to server.js to easily identify this is the server to use.
