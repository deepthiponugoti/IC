review: red in coverage

Notice red in coverage report.

Avoid alerts, they annoy the users.
May be some of the code can be reduced, for example, fewer loops?

review: good work

Nice work on location button feedback.

Feature complete. I did not review JavaScript since there were no tests.

review: fix browser incompatibility issue

Avoid using textfield for goelocation since that's editable on Chrome on OS X.

Minimize JavaScript spread in the html file.

review: give feedback to user

When user clicks on get location button give a cue that the app is working on it.

Make the button name GetLocation easy to read for human eyes.

In chrome, able to edit the location textfield. Make it non-editable.

review: A few things to fix

Allow Get Location to be clicked without error that fields don't have a value.

Provide email field.
